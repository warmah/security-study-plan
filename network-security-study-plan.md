# Network Security Study Plan

In this plan, let's assume that you **already** have some **computer science skills** (linux basics, common windows or mac os use, search on the internet, edit a file...). 
<br>
But first, **what** is **network security** ? Network security includes all **methods**, both **defensive** and **offensive**, to **protect** and **maintain functional** a network.

<br>

This plan has several objectives, in short :
- Understand networks and how it works
- Common vulnerabilities and how to detect them
- How to remedy these vulnerabilities and secure your network

# 1. Understand networks and how it works :
In this first part you will focus on learning the **basics concepts** of **networks** (architectures, protocols,...)
<br>

First you can check some youtube videos and playlists, such as :
- [Networking for Ethical Hackers](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLKT__MCUeiyUKmYaakznsZeU4lZYwt_j) from [The Cyber Mentor](https://www.youtube.com/@TCMSecurityAcademy)
- [You Suck at Subnetting](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIhvC56v63IKrRHh3gvZZBAGvsvOhwrRF) from [NetworkChuck](https://www.youtube.com/@NetworkChuck)
<a/>

<br>

Next you can check some **"learning paths"** from **tryhackme** (an online platform to learn **ethical hacking** and **cybersecurity** including **network security** where you will first need to create a **free account**) :
- [pre security training](https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/presecurity) (section 2 is the most important for network but others are interresting too)
- [beginner](https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/beginner) (section 3 is the most important for network but others are interresting too)
<br>

# 2. Common vulnerabilities and how to detect them :
Now that you have **basic knowledge** of **how networks works**, you will learn about some of the **most common vulnerabilities and attacks**.

Here is some tryhackme **modules** :
- [network security](https://tryhackme.com/module/network-security)
- [wireshark](https://tryhackme.com/module/wireshark)
- [Windows Exploitation](https://tryhackme.com/module/hacking-windows-1)
</a>

<br>

You can check too this playlist about a tool called **netcat** which is consider as the **"pentester swiss knife"** :  [HakTip: Netcat - Network Port Scanning, File Transfers, and More!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW5y1tjAOzI1v-RQ8rAftvqKawXQR87eL) from [Hak5](https://www.youtube.com/@hak5).

<br>

If you feel yourself ready, you can do some **rootme** (another online cybersecurity learning platform where you will need to create a **free account**) challenges, you can check those categories :
- [network](https://www.root-me.org/en/Challenges/Network/) (of course)
- [web - server](https://www.root-me.org/en/Challenges/Web-Server/) (interresting if you have some web hacking knowledges and want to work both on web and networks)

<br>

# 3. How to remedy these vulnerabilities and secure your network :
Now, you know how networks works, have knowledge of common attacks and vulnerabilites and you can use some useful **offensives network security tools**, so it's time to learn ways of **remediation** and standard **defensive network security tools**.

First, a youtube playlist (again) :
- [Blue Teaming and Network Defense Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0-xwzAwzllxblO9Pcx_iZTT_8uD7T83D) from [LoiLiangYang](https://www.youtube.com/@LoiLiangYang)
</a>

Then, some tryhackme modules :
- [Network Security and Traffic Analysis](https://tryhackme.com/module/network-security-and-traffic-analysis)
- [Network and System Security](https://tryhackme.com/module/network-and-system-security)
</a>

# Final advices : 

To finish with this plan, as I said above, you should at least create **free-accounts on platforms such as [tryhackme](https://tryhackme.com) or [rootme](https://root-me.org)**. This is useful to **learn cybersecurity** and developp **skills** and **knowledge**. 
<br>
<br>
You should create a [github](https://www.github.com) account too, to post code and **projects about cybersecurity or whatever you want** (if you don't code yet, please consider this other [tryhackme module](https://tryhackme.com/module/scripting-for-pentesters). After that, you will certainly **find content** on **youtube** to go further in **programming**, which is **more than useful** for **cybersecurity**.
<br>
<br>
A [X(twitter)](https://twitter.com) account can be **useful** too to **keep informed of cybersecurity news** and to **build a reputation into the domain**.
